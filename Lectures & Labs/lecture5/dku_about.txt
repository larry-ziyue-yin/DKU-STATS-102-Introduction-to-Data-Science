Duke Kunshan University is accredited by the Ministry of Education (MOE) of the People¡¯s Republic of China. Duke University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) in the United States to award baccalaureate, master¡¯s and doctorate degrees.
